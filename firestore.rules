/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the entire application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes simplicity and security. It focuses on controlling
 * access to the main `/content` document, allowing only authenticated users to
 * read and write the site's content.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - All site content is stored in a single document: `/content/{contentId}`
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Authenticated users can read content.
 * - Authenticated users can update content.
 * - No user-specific data is stored; therefore, no ownership checks are needed.
