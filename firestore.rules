/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the "proto0" project.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes simplicity and security, erring on the side of restrictive access control to protect data.
 * It assumes a central administrative model where an authenticated user manages all site content.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All editable website content is stored within a single document located at `/content/{contentId}`.  The contentId is expected to be a single, fixed document ID (e.g., "global_content").
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Content is only editable by authenticated users.
 *  - Listing the `/content` collection is disabled to prevent unintended data exposure.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - Not applicable here; all authorization decisions are based solely on user authentication.

     * @allow (create, update, delete): Only authenticated users can modify the content.

     * @principle Enforces authenticated-user-only access for content modification.
